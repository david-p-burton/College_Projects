<h1> Sci-Fi Heads Up Display (H.U.D)</h1>

This project is my Sci Fi Heads Up Display (H.U.D) for my OOP module at DIT. For this module we were tasked with creating a Sci FI HUD for which I was inspired by the animated series Neon Genesis Evangelion. The project is located in the SciFiHub2 folder in this repo.

This project was made with Processing 3.2.1 and was primarily developed on OSX El Capitan 10.11.3.

This project was an interesting one for me as I learned a lot about OOP during the course of this project. At the start I was still only becoming familiar with OOP concepts but by the end I have really come to grips with these concepts as well as classes and all these kinds of core programming ideas.

If I was going back to do this project again, I think it would look very different than what it looks like now. For a start, not as many single instances of objects would be created, but rather I would have used Polymorphism a lot more as well as ArrayLists.

As one goes through the code, it is almost possible to pin point the times were I finally understand the idea of classes or inheritance or when I get how PVectors work. It was through studying in class (as well as a lot of trial and error outside of class!) that allowed me implement some of these features in this project. I had to do an awful lot of extra code for this project that did not make it into the final assignment. For example, for nearly every feature you see in this project, I did a small sketch seperate to the main assignment to test out the idea. If it worked, I figured it into the project. If it didn't, well I either kept working on it or it was scrapped!

Overall I really enjoyed this project. Using processing is much more fluid that programming in C (which I would be much more accustomed to using). This assignment also allowed me to learn and practice and implement various OOP concepts. 

There are a few things in particular that I enjoyed coding up. For example I liked making the Portrait abstract class and then the subclass Icon and then the sub - subclass Bots. I liked this particually as I had never used inheritance before and it was very interesting to learn about this and then to go try it out and see it work!

I also am proud of the CPUClock I made. I admit this is a bad name and it should read MemoryTracker. The initial idea was to make a dial which kept a track of the % CPU power was being devoted to the program. In the end it made more sense to have a dial detailing the amount of memory devoted to the sketch when it is running.

The last thing I really enjoyed in this project was the World Status page. It was fun doing a bit of animation such as the contineously moving background and the text reveal.
